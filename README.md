# DriverStationInterface

C#/WPF GUI that runs on the driver station and communicates with the robot over TCP port 5800. Allows us to do fancy human interface stuff.

Notes:
- Visual Studio 2017 RC or later
- .NET Framework 4.5 only
- Use the existing directory structure
- Do not merge code that does not compile into master

More documentation to come later.
